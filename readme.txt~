You need to install:
https://litecoin.org/ 
http://www.privoxy.org/

torrc needs to be configured so that you have an onion url.
The onion url is used to share blocks between the miners.
---Add these lines to your torrc---
SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1
SocksPort 9050
ControlPort 9051
HiddenServiceDir /location/of/file/that/contains/this/readme
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:8071
-----------------------------------

privoxy config file needs a line uncommented. In mine it was about 1300 or so, it says:
        forward-socks5   /               127.0.0.1:9050 .
